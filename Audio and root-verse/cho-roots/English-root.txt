\v 1 Reverently bowing before the Blessed Ones, their Sons, the Body of the Law, and all the worshipful ones, I will briefly set forth in accordance with Holy Writ the way whereby the sons of the Blessed Ones enter the godly life. 
\b
\v 2 Nothing new will be told here, nor have I skill in writing of books; therefore I have done this work to hallow my own thoughts, not designing it for the welfare of others. 
\b
\v 3 By it the holy impulse within me to frame righteousness is strengthened; but if a fellow-creature should see it, this my book will fulfil another end likewise.
\b
\v 4 This brief estate, which once gotten is a means to all the aims of mankind, is exceeding hard to win; if one use it not for wholesome reflection, how shall it ever come again to his lot? 
\b
\v 5 As in the night, amidst the gross darkness of the clouds, the lightning shows for an instant its radiance, so by the grace of the Enlightened it may hap that the mind of man turn for an instant to holy works.

\v 6 ལེའུ་གཉིས་པ། To win this jewel of the Thought I offer perfect worship to the Blessed Ones, to the stainless gem of the Good Law, and to the Sons of the Enlightened, oceans of virtues. 
\b
\v 7 All flowers, fruits, and healing herbs, all gems and all waters clear and pleasent in the world, 
\b
\v 8 likewise mountains of jewels, forests sweet in their solitude, climbing plants bright with ornaments of flowers, trees whose branches bend with goodly fruit,
\b
\v 9 fragrant incenses, trees of desire, and jewel-bearing trees in the worlds of the gods and their kin, lakes bedecked with lilies and wondrously pleasant with the cries of swans,
\b
\v 10 harvests springing without tilth and crops of grain, and all else adorning them whom we worship, all things that are bounded by the spreading ethereal sphere and are in the possession of none, 
\b

\b
\v 11 ལེའུ་གསུམ་པ། I rejoice exceedingly in all creatures’ good works that end the sorrows of their evil lot; may the sorrowful find happiness! 
\b
\v 12  I rejoice in the deliverance of embodied beings from the griefs of life’s wanderings, and in the Sonship of Enlightenment, and the Enlightenment that belongs to the Saviours.
\b
\v 13 I rejoice in the Commanders’ oceans of Thought, that bring happiness and establish welfare for all creatures.
\b
\v 14 With clasped hands I entreat the perfectly Enlightened Ones who stand in all regions that they kindle the lamp of the Law for them who in their blindness fall into sorrow.
\b
\v 15 With clasped hands I pray the Conquerors who yearn for the Stillness that they abide here for endless aeons, lest this world become blind.
